# Dynamic Pricing Model for Fitness Classes

This repository contains the analysis and algorithmic implementation for a **rule-based dynamic pricing strategy** designed to optimize revenue and attendance for a fitness class business.

The primary deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook (`Dynamic pricing algorithms and rules document.ipynb`) that documents the data cleaning process, analytical findings, and the final logic for applying price adjustments based on demand, class popularity, and time slots.

## üöÄ Key Features of the Dynamic Pricing Strategy

The model implements three core rules to dynamically adjust class prices, aiming to maximize revenue during high-demand periods and stimulate bookings during off-peak times:

| Pricing Rule | Description | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Surge Pricing** | Implements a **5-10% price increase** for classes scheduled on **weekends and peak evening hours** to capitalize on high demand. | Maximize revenue during peak periods. |
| **Premium Pricing** | Applies an additional **10% premium** to the **top 5 most popular classes**, leveraging their established brand and consistent high booking rates. | Capitalize on proven popular offerings. |
| **Off-Peak Discounts** | Introduces a **5% discount** on classes offered during **weekdays and non-peak hours** to stimulate demand and optimize resource utilization. | Boost attendance during slow periods. |

## üíª Technology Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries:** `pandas` and `numpy`  for data cleaning, transformation, and applying the pricing logic.
* **Data:** The analysis utilizes historical fitness class data from **April to June 2018** for strategy testing and validation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation & Next Steps

The provided Jupyter Notebook serves as the documentation and working prototype for the pricing logic.

Future steps for this project include:

1.  **Deployment:** Developing and deploying the final dynamic pricing algorithm into the live booking system.
2.  **Monitoring:** Tracking the performance of the new pricing strategy and collecting feedback from customers.
3.  **Refinement:** Continuously refining the pricing model using new, real-time data to further optimize revenue and attendance.

## üìÇ File Structure

* `Dynamic pricing algorithms and rules document.ipynb`: The core notebook containing the data analysis, pricing rule documentation, and Python code for implementing the price changes.
* `Fitness Classes Data/`: Directory containing the initial data files (e.g., `Classes April-May 2018.csv`, `Classes June 2018.csv`).
* `Cleaned_Classes_Data.csv`: The output file generated by the notebook, containing the cleaned and transformed class data used for analysis.
